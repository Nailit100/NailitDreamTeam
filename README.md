# NailitDreamTeam
OurOverview
NailIt is a student-led ed-tech start-up based in the Norman area that aims to help first-year to
junior undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma improve their academic
performance.
OurIdea Origin-Problem
Allegra Shaffer is a political science major at the University of Oklahoma. Like many
students during the Fall 2020 semester, Shaffer quarantined and attended classes on Zoom for
nearly the entire semester . Online learning has been challenging for Shaffer . Shaffer had
access to fewer resources, including instructors during the Fall.  As a result, Shaffer fell
behind academically . Shaffer is not the only student who regressed academically; the OU
Daily reported over 2,000 OU students petitioned to implement a pass/no pass grading policy
in the Fall. Thus, it became clear that many students are now struggling and will keep
struggling if no one does not do anything about it.
Revolted by this situation and determined to further the #Lead On Project of academic
excellence, a diverse group of students started NailIt, an online platform to equip and prepare
students for academic assessments at the University of Oklahoma.
Detailed Project Description (Solution)
